## Game Mechanics Breakdown

### Scoring System
- **Time-based**: +1 point per second survived
- **Coins**: +2 to +5 points depending on type
- **Bonuses**: +10 for destroying FUD walls
- **Multipliers**: Power-ups increase point values

### Difficulty Progression
- **Base Speed**: 200 pixels/second
- **Speed Increase**: +10 pixels/second every 10 seconds
- **Max Speed**: 400 pixels/second
- **Obstacle Spawn**: Every 2 seconds
- **Gap Size**: 200 pixels (adjustable in config)

### Power-up System
| Power-up | Duration | Effect |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Buyback Mode | 5 seconds | Invincibility + coin magnet (150px radius) |
| Freedom Flight | 5 seconds | Speed boost |
| Bonk Bark | One-time | Destroys next obstacle |
| Burger Fuel | 5 seconds | Enhanced jump + 5 bonus points |

### Unlockable Content
